# Contemporary Issues In Data
In this document, I discuss two articles about alcohol consumption. I present and discuss two opposing views on this important matter. 

## Article 1 
In The New York Times' article [Even a Little Alcohol Can Harm Your Health] (https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/13/well/mind/alcohol-health-effects.html), the author talks about how even a little bit of alcohol can harm the body contradicting the decades of research which talks about how alcohol, only in large quantities, can have health consequences.  

I absolutely agree with this article. Alcohol may not have immediate effect on the body, but may cause severe health issues in the long run. Scientists talk about how alcohol damages the DNA and once it is damaged, then a cell can grow out of control and create a cancer tumor.


## Article 2 
In The Wall Street Journal's article [A Little Alcohol Wonâ€™t Kill You or Make You Stronger] (https://www.wsj.com/articles/alcohol-long-term-health-risks-c6d572d2), the author talks about how a bit of alcohol here and there does not kill you. It mentions how an average man can drink up to about three drinks a day and expect to live as long as nondrinkers. 

I don't completely agree with this view on alcohol consumption. It is normalizing alcohol consumption in limited quantities without clearly stating the negative impacts. This may lead to lack of awareness amongst people, especially drinkers.
